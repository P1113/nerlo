OVERVIEW
--------

"nerlo" will be an Erlang bridge to the neo4j graph database.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For now, you should not expect 
anything to work :)



DEPENDENCIES
------------

JDK >= 1.6.0
Erlang >= R13B03
GNU make
Ant >= 1.8 (lower may work as well)
commons-cli-1.2
log4j--1.2.15

NOTE: Dependency management is by hand for now. Later we may
use Ivy or Maven for Java dependencies.


BUILD
-----

You may try to build from source like this:

$ ./conf.sh
$ cd erl && make
$ cd java && ant


RUN
---

$ cd erl
$ bin/shell
erl 1> ej_srv:start().
erl 2> ej_srv:stop().
