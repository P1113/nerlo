OVERVIEW
--------

Eventually "nerlo" will be an Erlang bridge to the 
neo4j graph database, maybe slightly more.

For now, you should not expect anything to work :)


DEPENDENCIES
------------

JDK >= 1.6.0
Erlang >= R13B04
GNU make
Ant >= 1.8 (lower may work as well)

commons-cli-1.2
log4j-1.2.15
lucene-core-2.9.1.jar
geronimo-jta_1.1_spec-1.1.1.jar
neo4j-kernel-1.0.jar
neo4j-index-1.0.jar
neo4j-commons-1.0.jar

NOTE: Dependency management is by hand for now. 
Later we may use Ivy or Maven for Java dependencies.


BUILD
-----

You may try to build from source like this:

$ ./conf.sh
$ cd java && ant jar
$ cd erl && make


RUN
---

$ cd erl
$ bin/shell
erl 1> ej_app:start().
erl 2> ej_srv:ping().
erl 3> ej_app:stop().
